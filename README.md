# Wing Portal

## Introduction

[Wing Portal](https://www.wingportal.co/), built as a gift for California, is a sculpture of transcendence made from the ruins of the 2018 fires.  As a visual metaphor to transcendence, our team is building a monument out of the ruins from the fire and is bringing it to another place of deep personal transformation: Burning Man. After the Burn, the sculpture will be publicly installed in California. The wings span 80 ft. across, and are  built out of recycled metal, iridescent panels and thousands of LED lights.

## Software

This is the animation engine and development environment for the Wing Portal. It is an open-source application that runs in [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) using the P3LX framework.

To get started, grab the latest version of Processing 3 at: https://processing.org/download/

Then, simply clone or download the repo and open the project in Processing. The best way to get started is by having a look at the "Tutorial" tab, which shows how the basic features of pattern construction work.

The LX API reference is available at: http://lx.studio/api/
